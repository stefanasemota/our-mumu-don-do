      "text": "Grandpa pulled up a holographic image of a young boy on the old Bonny docks. \"It started with his eyes, Tolu. Before he was King Jaja, he was Mbanaso. He arrived at this river as a newcomer with nothing of his own. While others looked at the ground in sadness, Mbanaso looked at the horizon. He realized that if you can map the world in your mind, no one can keep your spirit in a cage.\""

      "text": "Mbanaso didn't just work; he studied. He learned the languages of the sailors and the rhythm of the tides. He saw that the \"Oil Rivers\" were a giant puzzle, and he was the only one putting the pieces together. He told himself, ‘My hands may be working for others today, but my mind is already a Master.’"

      "text": "Because he saw what others missed, he became the greatest trader in the House of Anna Pepple. When the elders were in debt and afraid, Jaja stepped forward. He didn't use a sword; he used his brain. He reorganized the trade, paid the debts, and was elected leader—the first time an outsider had ever risen so high."

      "text": "But Jaja’s vision was even bigger. When rivals tried to block his path, he didn't stay to beg for space. He decided to build his own! He led thousands of people through the secret, winding creeks of the Delta to a brand new location. He called it Opobo—the Place of Promise."

      "text": "In Opobo, Jaja was no longer a newcomer; he was a King. He built a city so powerful that even queens from across the ocean sent him letters of respect. He controlled the palm oil that the whole world wanted. He proved that a map drawn with vision is more powerful than a wall built with stone."
